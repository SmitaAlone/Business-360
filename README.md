Business related terms

* Gross price
  
  Gross price refers to the total price of a product or service before any deductions, discounts, or taxes are applied. It represents the full cost of the item or service without considering any additional expenses or reductions. It's essentially the initial, unadjusted price that the buyer pays before any adjustments are made.

* Pre-invoice deductions
  
   Pre-invoice deductions in finance refer to reductions made to an invoice amount before it is issued, typically for adjustments or corrections in pricing, discounts, or allowances. These deductions are applied before the final invoice is generated, ensuring accuracy in the billing process.
  
* Post-Invoice deductions
  
  Post-invoice deductions in finance are adjustments made to an invoice amount after it has been issued, often due to discrepancies, returns, or negotiated discounts, ensuring accurate accounting and reflecting the true financial transaction.

* Net Invoice sale
  
   Net invoice sale in finance represents the final amount payable by the customer after deducting any pre-invoice or post-invoice deductions from the gross invoice amount, reflecting the actual value of the goods or services sold.

* Gross Margin
  
   Gross margin is the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of revenue. It indicates the profitability of a company's core business activities before accounting for other expenses such as overhead and taxes.

* Net sales
  
   Net sales represent the total revenue generated by a company from its core business activities after deducting returns, allowances, and discounts. It reflects the actual amount received from customers for goods or services sold, providing a clearer picture of the company's sales performance.

* Net profit
  
   Net profit, also known as net income or bottom line, is the amount remaining after deducting all expenses, including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, taxes, and any other applicable charges, from the total revenue earned by a company. It is a key measure of a company's profitability and reflects its overall financial performance.

* COGC - cost of goods sold
  
   Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) refers to the direct expenses incurred by a company in producing the goods or services that were sold during a specific period. It typically includes costs such as raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. COGS is subtracted from revenue to calculate gross profit and is a crucial metric for assessing a company's profitability and operational efficiency.

* YTD - Year to Date
  
    YTD (Year to Date) refers to the period beginning from the start of the current calendar year up to the present date. It provides a cumulative summary of financial or operational data for the ongoing year, allowing for comparisons and analysis over time. YTD figures are often used in financial reporting to assess performance and track progress against annual goals or benchmarks.

* YTG - Year to Go
  
   "YTG" typically stands for "Year to Go," which refers to the remaining period of time within the current calendar year from the present date until the end of the year. It represents the duration or timeframe left for accomplishing goals, meeting targets, or completing tasks within the context of the ongoing year.

* Direct
  
   "Direct" in finance often refers to costs or expenses directly attributable to a specific activity, product, or service. These costs can be easily traced back to the production or provision of a particular item or service. Direct costs are typically variable and include expenses such as raw materials, labor directly involved in production, and direct overhead costs directly associated with manufacturing or providing a service. They are distinguished from indirect costs, which are not directly tied to a specific activity or product and are typically fixed in nature.

* Retailer
  
    A retailer is a business that sells goods or services directly to consumers through various channels, acting as an intermediary between manufacturers and end-users, providing convenient access to products. They operate physical stores, online platforms, or both, catering to consumer demand and offering a diverse range of products for purchase.

* Distributors
  
    Distributors are entities that purchase products in bulk from manufacturers and sell them to retailers or end-users. They play a vital role in the supply chain by efficiently distributing goods to various markets, providing logistical support, and often offering value-added services such as storage, packaging, and delivery.

* Consumer
  
  Consumers are individuals or entities that purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption. They are the end-users of products or services offered by businesses, and their buying behavior and preferences influence market demand and shape business strategies.

Company Intro -

AltiQ Hardware is a big company that sells computers and accessories worldwide through different ways like selling in stores, selling directly, and using distributors. They hit a problem when they opened a store in America and lost money unexpectedly. To avoid this happening again, they need to start using data and facts more to make smarter decisions. They're starting a project to build a team that can help them do this. In the first meeting, they'll talk about what exactly they want to achieve with this project and why it's important. They'll also answer any questions people have about it.

Higher customer satisfaction

Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purpose

The table is denormalized by data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
